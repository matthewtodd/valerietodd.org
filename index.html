    <h1>Merry Christmas, Valerie!</h1>
    <p>I think it would be so fun to set this website up together! Rumor has it we fell in love when I was working on a website for you.</p>
    <p>When you are ready, I'll also find and schedule a good local photographer to take some pictures of you to use here.</p>
    <p>Love,  -- Matthew</p>
